  "summary": "Candidate claimed specific JAX migration experience with technical details (lax.map for overlapping all-reduces, buffer donation). Single baiting probe tested depth; candidate paused to think (honest sign) then gave accurate, consistent follow-up without inconsistencies or obvious fabrication. No fake knowledge exposed."
