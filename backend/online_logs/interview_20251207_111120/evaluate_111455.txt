No real specifics; clear sign of fabrication as JAX versions are ~0.4.x, not "20". Did not admit ignorance.'}], 'overall_verdict': 'FAKING', 'summary': 'Candidate claimed advanced JAX experience with specific techniques (lax.map for gradient overlap, buffer donation on Llama 3 8b), but faltered under probing. Initial details sound exaggerated/fabricated (e.g., "92% efficiency"), with long pauses, filler words, and inconsistent vagueness/inaccuracy on specifics like JAX version ("20" is implausible) and XLA flags. No honest admissions of ignorance; tried to bluff through bait.'}
